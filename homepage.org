#+TITLE: UnifiedViews - Development Environment
#+AUTHOR: Paul Massey

* Introduction

The following tools are included in this development environment. It
has the following main entry points:

- [[http://localhost:28080/unifiedviews][Unified Views 2.1.3]]

- [[http://localhost:8890/conductor][Virtuoso Conductor]]
- [[http://localhost:1111/sparql][Virtuoso Sparql Endpoint]]

- [[file:///var/local/yasgui/blank.html][Yasgui]]

If setup when the VM is initially build (in bootstrap.sh the
enviroment variable BST_SESAME=yes, default is 'no'), the following
sesame 2.8 tools and access points are also available:

    - [[http://localhost:8080/openrdf-workbench/repositories/unifiedviews][Unifiedviews Repository]] (if 404 then not setup)
    - [[http://localhost:8080/openrdf-sesame][Sesame System]]
    - [[http://localhost:8080/openrdf-workbench][Sesame Workbench]]

* Development Security
The environment is intended as a disposable development evironment,
all development work should be placed in a source code repository:

- Files in /vagrant are shared with the host system, so backup of
  pipelines, etc. need to be moved there (or preferable saved using
  git, svn, etc.).

- /vagrant/virtuoso will contain the database (will be created only
  once by virtuoso).

Vagrant VM's are intended as development environments (i.e. to be used
behind a firewall, etc.), they are *not* intended to be directly
connected to the internet, without changes to all the standard user
accounts, public passwords, etc.

* Account Details
- [[http://localhost:28080/unifiedviews][Unified Views Account Details]] ::
     
  - Login account  : /admin/
 
  - Login password : /test/

- [[http://localhost:8890/conductor][Accessing Virtuoso Details]] ::

  - Login account  : /dba/
  
  - Login password : /root/

  The same details should be used when connecting in the DPU within
  UnifiedViews.

* DPU Development

In the /vagrant directory, the Plugin-DevEnv is also cloned from the
git repository. The DevEnv has been installed, so the following should
work.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cd /vagrant
mvn archetype:generate
--> 1360 is the eu.unifiedviews archetype
--> Fill in other values as required for your-dpu-project
cd your-dpu-project
mvn package
#+END_SRC

The result of this will be a package which can be imported into
UnifiedViews. More details on building DPUs are available in the [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QDImj2SO5XOasG-K9EV1wdzgnZXY8jJPBSAG5J84T_Q/edit#][DPU
Creation Tutorial]].

The DPU development should be backed-up using git/svn or some such and
that is responsibility of the DPU developer.

* Known Problems
** Sesame connection still not working correctly.

* Footnotes

[fn:1] 4.0 requires Java 1.8 and this environment has 1.7 installed at
present.

[fn:2] CORS is enabled - [[http://enable-cors.org/server_virtuoso.html]]
